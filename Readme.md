â›” DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to integrate the [End-User Web Report Designer](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/creating-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/report-designer?v=19.1) in JavaScript with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The project uses the [Bower](https://bower.io/) package manager.

For a step-by-step tutorial, refer to the following help topic: [Report Designer Integration in ReactJS](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/119339/creating-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/using-reporting-controls-in-js/report-designer-integration-in-reactjs?v=19.1).

Starting from v19.2, you should use the **npm package manager**. You can find an updated version of the example here:
